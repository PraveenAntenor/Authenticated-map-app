# Authenticated-map-app
This project is a secure, React-based web application that allows users to log in with Google, interact with a live map, select two points, and draw a route between them using the Google Directions API. Itâ€™s built as part of an assignment for ProductLabs and showcases key skills in full-stack development, user authentication, and map-based APIs.
